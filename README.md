# Random Wheel Spinner

## Overview
This project requires a folder named **`savedClasses`** containing the runnable JAR and the **`win.wav`** sound file for proper functionality.  

The wheel is generated when a CSV file of names is uploaded using the **Load** button. The **Side Panel** displays all the names currently in the wheel, while the **Bottom Panel** shows names that were previously removed. Both active and removed names are saved when the user clicks **Save**.  

The program includes several features such as sound effects, the ability to add and delete classes, and real-time updates when names are added or removed.  

## My Contributions
- Developed the **Wheel** functionality for spinning and selecting names.  
- Implemented the **Bottom Panel** to manage removed names.  
- Made changes to other classes (`Classes`, `SidePanel`, `Control_Panel`) for integration and state management.  

## Team
We were a group of **4 students** at Eastern High School, and all members contributed equally to the project.

## Usage
1. Ensure the **`savedClasses`** folder is in the same directory as the JAR file.  
2. Ensure **`win.wav`** is in the same directory.  
3. Run the JAR file and use the **Load** button to upload a CSV of names.  
4. Interact with the wheel, side panel, and bottom panel as needed.  
5. Use **Save** to preserve changes for future sessions.
